        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</li><br>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media.</li><br>
            <li><span class = "first1">Css is not necessary</span> <span class  = "first2">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li><br>
            <li><span class = "first3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using the style elements in the head section </li>
            <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class = "first2">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstarte,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and its used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific elements or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles cab be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is  a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
